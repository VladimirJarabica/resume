                  I worked on a major initiative to modernize the frontend
                  architecture, transforming a legacy Java-rendered portlet
                  system into a scalable micro-frontend architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I designed and proposed solutions across the full stack,
                  including application routing, bundling strategies, CI/CD
                  pipelines, data-fetching patterns, and testing approaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was a highly ambitious and challenging project that
                  required deep involvement across all layers of a complex web
                  application and close collaboration with multiple teams.

                  Slab was my first hands-on experience with a fully remote and
                  English-only company. There were no official role names, like
                  junior or senior, although we strove for the highest code
                  quality and responsibility for the outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remote work demands self-discipline and time management,
                  especially in different time zones. Therefore, asynchronous
                  communication and clear writing was required and supported.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My primary focus was on the Slab application, touching
                  frontend technologies like Graphql or Apollo. We ensured the
                  code quality through the unit, visual and integration tests. I
                  have also contributed to the desktop version written in
                  Electron.

                  <strong>Senior Frontend Developer</strong> (Apr 2020 - Jan
                  2021): After switching to remote work, I handed over my
                  responsibilities as a team leader. I dove deeper into
                  technical parts like refactors, testing, and architecture
                  design, exploring new opportunities to be beneficial for my
                  team and the product.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Technical Team Lead</strong> (Nov 2018 - Mar 2020): I
                  gained more responsibility as a leader of a team of javascript
                  developers, combining technical quality with fulfilling the
                  company's needs. I was part of the developer hiring process,
                  proposed and implemented architectural decisions, code
                  reviews, and refactoring to ensure code health. I planned,
                  allocated team resources, estimated task difficulty, and
                  prioritized.
                </p>

                  <strong>Senior Frontend Developer</strong> (Jul 2018 - Oct
                  2018): Cross-team communication became a bigger part of my
                  daily work. I was responsible for larger projects, code
                  quality, technical decisions, and ideas. I contributed to
                  frontend payment implementation, server-side rendering, state
                  management changes, large refactors, and tracking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> (Jul 2016 - Jun 2018): I
                  worked with big React projects and related technologies such
                  as immutability, Google Maps, Mapbox, and Node.js. My
                  responsibility was to be a valid team member, keep growing,
                  and continuously challenge myself with more demanding tasks.

                  I provided general maintenance and development of multiple

                  responsible for developing presentational websites based on
                  CMS like Joomla, but mostly WordPress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I adjusted plugins, templates, and JavaScript code. My
                  responsibility was delivering websites according to design and
                  communicating with clients.
